## Project Overview
The goal of this analysis is to explore the factors affecting car selling prices and to visualize these relationships. This project utilizes Python and libraries such as Pandas and Matplotlib for data manipulation and visualization.

### Objectives
- Analyze how various attributes (e.g., fuel type, transmission) influence car selling prices.
- Identify trends in car prices based on manufacturing year and other factors.
- Visualize findings to effectively communicate insights gained from the analysis.

## Installation
To set up your environment for this project, make sure you have the following prerequisites:
- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab
- Necessary libraries listed in `requirements.txt`

### Installation Steps
1. Clone the repository.
2. Install the required libraries.
3. Start Jupyter Notebook.

## Usage
To run the analysis:
1. Open the Jupyter Notebook file named `portfolio_analysis.ipynb`.
2. Execute each cell in sequence to perform the data analysis and view results.

## Data
The dataset used for this project is `car_sell.csv`, which includes the following fields:

| Field Name       | Description                                            |
|------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| **name**         | Car type of the sold vehicle                           |
| **year**         | Year when the car was purchased                        |
| **selling_price**| Price at which the car is sold                         |
| **km_driven**    | Total kilometers driven by the car                     |
| **fuel**         | Type of fuel used (petrol, diesel, CNG, LPG, electric)|
| **seller_type**  | Indicates whether the seller is an individual or dealer|
| **transmission** | Gear transmission type (automatic/manual)             |
| **owner**        | Number of previous owners of the car                   |

## Analysis Questions
This project seeks to address the following key questions:
1. How do factors such as fuel type and transmission influence car selling prices?
2. What trends can be observed in car prices based on the year of manufacture?
3. Is there a significant difference in selling prices among different fuel types?
4. How does the distance driven (in kilometers) impact the selling price of a vehicle?

## Methodology
The analysis involves several key steps:
1. **Data Cleaning**: Addressing missing values and ensuring the dataset is properly formatted for analysis.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Utilizing statistical methods and visualizations to explore relationships and trends within the data.
3. **Visualization**: Employing various plots and graphs to effectively present findings, such as scatter plots for price vs. kilometers driven and bar charts for fuel type comparisons.

## Results and Visualizations
The results section in the Jupyter Notebook summarizes significant findings from the analysis, highlighting:
- Correlation matrices to determine relationships between numerical attributes.
- Box plots that illustrate the distribution of selling prices across different fuel types.
- Trend lines that depict changes in selling prices over time.

### Example Visualizations
- **Scatter Plot**: Showing the relationship between selling price and kilometers driven.
- **Bar Chart**: Comparing average selling prices by fuel type.
- **Line Graph**: Indicating price trends over the years.

## Conclusion
The analysis provides valuable insights into how different factors affect car selling prices, aiding buyers and sellers in making informed decisions. Recommendations based on the findings will be presented in the notebook.
